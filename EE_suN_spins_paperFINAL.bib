  abstract={We carry out a systematic study of entanglement entropy in relativistic quantum field theory. This is defined as the von Neumann entropy S A = −Tr ρ A logρ A corresponding to the reduced density matrix ρ A of a subsystem A . For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c , we re-derive the result ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002/jstat181343ieqn1.gif] {S_{\mathrm {A}}\sim (c/3)\log \ell} of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002/jstat181343ieqn2.gif] {\ell} in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length ξ is large but finite, we show that ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002/jstat181343ieqn3.gif] {S_{\mathrm {A}}\sim {\cal A}(c/6)\log \xi } , where ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002/jstat181343ieqn4.gif] {\cal A} is the number of boundary points of A . These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.}

We also point out that the last type of corrections can also occur with x less than 2. They arise from relevant operators induced by the conical spacetime singularities necessary to describe the reduced density matrix. These agree with recent analytic and numerical results for quantum spin chains. We also compute the effect of marginally irrelevant bulk operators, which give a correction ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2010/04/P04023/jstat352740ieqn5.gif] {\Or ((\log \ell)^{-2})} , with a universal amplitude. We present analogous results for the case when the interval lies at the end of a semi-infinite system.}

In the case of a semi-infinite system and a block starting from the boundary, we derive rigorously the asymptotic behavior for large block sizes on the basis of a recent mathematical theorem for the determinant of Toeplitz plus Hankel matrices. We conjecture a generalized Fisher–Hartwig form for the corrections to the asymptotic behavior of this determinant that allows the exact characterization of the corrections to the scaling at order ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2011/01/P01017/jstat378734ieqn1.gif] {\mathrm {o}(\ell^{-1})} for any n .
